                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a> is a programming paradigm in 
                computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
                It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces 
                of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create 
                individual instances of objects.</article>
